# Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks for LLMs

**Abstract Reasoning Definition**

In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), abstract reasoning is defined as the ability to:

1.  **Abstraction:** Extract essential patterns and underlying structures from concrete instances, independent of superficial details or specific symbolic representations. This involves information compression, generalization, and focusing on core, reasoning-relevant features.
2.  **Reasoning:** Apply consistent rules, logical operations, and inferential processes to these abstracted patterns to derive new conclusions, solve problems, and make predictions. This goes beyond simple pattern matching or memorization, requiring genuine understanding of abstract relationships and rules.

The benchmarks listed below are designed to evaluate these two core processes in LLMs, particularly focusing on tasks that require invariance to surface-level changes and generalization to novel situations based on abstract understanding.
